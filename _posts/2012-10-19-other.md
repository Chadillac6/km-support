The following libraries are 3rd-party libraries written by the KISSmetrics community. 

<p class="critical">
KISSmetrics does <strong>not</strong> provide official support for these libraries, may not have reviewed them to see if they work, and makes no warranty about them. They are still worth investigating <strong>at your own risk</strong> if your application can't use our official libraries.
</p>

If you have a library you would like to add to this list, please [contact us][contact-us].
