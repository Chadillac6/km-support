## 1. Live Does Not Show Data

Live is a feed of events that happen **from the moment your browser connects to Live, going forward**. This implies a few things:

- **Are the events you expect triggering?** Having the JavaScript Library installed will [automatically give you a few events][auto], mostly describing behavior of people entering your site. If you want to track activity of what people are doing *on* your site, you'll need to tell us what activities are important to be tracked.

  *Our code should be installed on the pages you are tracking. Then, you can use our Event Library to start adding tracking to events you're interested in.*

- **Events done in the past are not displayed**. Live does not show you what happened before you opened the tab. If you started browsing your site before opening the tab, you will have triggered Visited Site in the recent past, so Visited Site event will not appear in Live.

  *Try triggering events after your browser has connected to Live. Alternatively, try browsing your site in a different browser, or in a private browsing window.*

- **Are the events you want to see hidden?**. In the Event Library, you can hide events so that they do not clutter your event menus in reports. However, this also hides the events from Live.

  If you are expecting certain events to appear, check that they are not hidden in the Event Library. Alternatively, you can do the same in this [lists of all events][e-list] - toggle the on/off switch at the top to show hidden events.

- **Your Event Library changes may not have updated yet.** It takes a few minutes for changes in the Event Library to update your KISSmetrics JavaScript file with new events.

## 2. I saw my data in Live, but not in any of my other reports

Within 2-6 hours from the moment an event is triggered, this data will be available in the rest of our reports - funnels, cohort reports, people search, revenue report, and metrics. It's a good sign if your events came through Live. You can see how up-to-date your data is by referring to the [right sidebar of your settings page][settings].
